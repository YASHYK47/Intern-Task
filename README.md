The solution is explained as- A user enters his/her credentials and from these credentials email is checked in DB if it is already in use.In case it is already in use then error is prompted else email verification is done.
In email verification, a token is sent to the entered email and when clicked to this token user will be redirected to the confirmation page.
Once the email is verified, user can proceed to use the scheduler for planning different meetings,
A user can create meeting and add participants of meetings one by one,view past meetings and accept/reject invitations of other meetings.
